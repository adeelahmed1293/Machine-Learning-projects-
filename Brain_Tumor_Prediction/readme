Brain Tumor Prediction Using Deep Learning

Project Overview

This project uses deep learning techniques to predict the presence and type of brain tumors from MRI images. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and can classify tumors into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary.

Features

Deep learning-based model for brain tumor prediction
Trained on a dataset of labeled MRI images
Can classify tumors into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary
Streamlit web app for easy user interaction and prediction
Streamlit Web App

The project includes a Streamlit web app that allows users to upload their MRI images and receive predictions on the presence and type of brain tumor. The app is user-friendly and provides a simple interface for users to interact with the model.

Model Performance

The model has been trained and tested on a dataset of labeled images and has achieved high accuracy in predicting the presence and type of brain tumors.

Technologies Used

Python
Deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, Keras)
Streamlit for web app development
OpenCV for image processing
NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
How to Use

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
Run the Streamlit web app using streamlit run app.py.
Upload your MRI image to the app and receive predictions on the presence and type of brain tumor.
Future Work

Collect and label more data to improve the model's performance.
Experiment with different deep learning architectures and techniques to improve the model's accuracy.
Deploy the model in a clinical setting for real-world testing and validation.

"I'm excited to share my latest project, a deep learning-based brain tumor prediction model! I built a Streamlit web app that allows users to upload their MRI images and receive predictions on the presence and type of brain tumor. The model has been trained and tested on a dataset of labeled images and has achieved high accuracy. I'm proud of what I've accomplished and I'm looking forward to continuing to work on this project and improving its performance.
