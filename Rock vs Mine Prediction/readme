# Rock vs Mine Prediction for Submarines using SONAR Data
===========================================================

## Introduction
------------

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine based on SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) data. This is a critical task for submarines to avoid collisions with underwater mines.

## Background
------------

Submarines use SONAR systems to detect and classify underwater objects. However, distinguishing between rocks and mines is a challenging task due to the similarities in their acoustic signatures. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns in the SONAR data and make accurate predictions.

## Problem Statement
-------------------

The problem is to classify an underwater object as either a rock or a mine based on a set of features extracted from SONAR data. The features include:

* Acoustic signals reflected from the object
* Time-frequency characteristics of the signals
* Spatial characteristics of the object

## Dataset
------------

The dataset used for this project consists of 209 samples, each representing a rock or a mine. The dataset is divided into two classes:

* Rock: 111 samples
* Mine: 98 samples

Each sample is described by 61 features extracted from the SONAR data.

## Methodology
--------------

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to classify the underwater objects. Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is well-suited for binary classification problems.

### Data Preprocessing

The dataset was preprocessed to remove any missing values and normalize the features.

### Model Training

The Logistic Regression model was trained using the preprocessed dataset. The model was trained using a 80-20 split, where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% was used for testing.

### Model Evaluation

The performance of the model was evaluated using the following metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score

## Results
---------



## Conclusion
----------

The Logistic Regression model demonstrated excellent performance in classifying underwater objects as rocks or mines. The results show that the model can accurately predict the class of an object based on the SONAR data.

## Future Work
--------------

Future work includes:

* Collecting more data to improve the model's performance
* Exploring other machine learning algorithms for classification
* Developing a real-time system for deployment on submarines

## Code
------

The code for this project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn

The code is available in the `rock_vs_mine.py` file.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('sonar.csv')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('target', axis=1), df['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
